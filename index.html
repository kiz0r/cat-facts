            The oldest known pet cat existed 9,500 years ago
          </h2>
          <p class="articleContent">
            This interesting fact about cats is guaranteed to wow at your next
            dinner party. Did you know that originally it was thought that
            Egyptians domesticated the cat? But in 2004, French archaeologists
            discovered a 9,500 year old cat grave in Cyprus. This makes this the
            oldest known pet cat and it predates Egyptian art about cats by over
            4,000 years!
